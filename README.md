# Terminal IDE

An IDE that runs within the Python terminal, it allows the user to edit and run lines that they specify. It writes the user's code to a function in another file and then imports the file and runs a function. It can handle errors and tells the user there is an error (although not which error...).

It was a small thing I made one evening, but I find it quite cool! You can even do an while True loop and it will execute as normal. :)
